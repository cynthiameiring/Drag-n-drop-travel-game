## Preface

This project was build in week 10 of the Codaisseur bootcamp. The goal was to build an app in 4 days with a technology we didn't learn before. This app is made for childeren who want to learn the Dutch language in a playfull way, by dragging letters into the right place and guessing the word. React-dnd is used as the "new technology" to make it possible to drag and drop elements.
